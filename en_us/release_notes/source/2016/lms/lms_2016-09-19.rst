This release includes the following updates to the LMS.

* Discussion posts are now identified as having been read when you interact
  with a post on a mobile device. Previously, interactions such as adding a
  response or comment to a post, or answering a question or marking a question
  as answered, caused the post to be identified as unread. (`jira:MA-2139`_)

* New users who register an account while using a screen reader can now access
  the edX terms and services page.  (`jira:AC-578`_)

* On both the registration and sign in pages, the contrast has been increased
  for the text that appears below the **Email** and **Password** fields.
  (`jira:AC-577`_)

* Users who access a survey created by the :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Survey
  Tool` with a screen reader now hear the relevant question and answer text for
  each poll answer option.
